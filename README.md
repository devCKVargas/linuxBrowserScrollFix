# Browser Scroll Fix for GNU/Linux

A script that enables the Windows middle-click scrolling feature for some of the popular Chromium-based browsers on Linux (tested on Arch & Arch-based distros).

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devckvargas/linuxbrowserscrollfix && 
cd linuxbrowserscrollfix/scripts &&
./fixScroll.sh
```

Browsers will tell you that it's an unsupported flag, just ignore by closing the [popup warning](#popup-warning) (recommended)
